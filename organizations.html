                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>
                    <em>Girls Who Code</em> is a free, application-based program that I participated in during the summer of 2022. 
                    It's goal is to create a sisterhood of women in computer science, where participants could talk to each 
                    other, ask for advice, and feel like a part of an open, supportive community. Different women in computer 
                    science fields presented and shared their professional experiences and advice.
                    
                </p>
                <h3>Skills</h3>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design an interactive website, and created a bare-bones
                    portfolio website, as well as a personality quiz website, which let the user answer questions and told 
                    them if they were more similar to Barbie or Raquelle from "Barbie, life in the dreamhouse".
